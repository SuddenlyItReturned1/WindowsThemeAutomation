# WindowsThemeAutomation
Just a simple script to automate the os theme based on the day on devices running windows. \n
By default it changes to dark theme by 12:00AM \n
And to light theme by 7:00AM \n
You can modify those values by modifying the "change_theme_to_dark_time" and "change_theme_to_light_time" variable. \n
This script is tested and working on Windows 10.
