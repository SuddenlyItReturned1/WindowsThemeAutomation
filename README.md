# WindowsThemeAutomation
Just a simple script to automate the os theme based on the day on devices running windows.

By default it changes to dark theme by 12:00AM

And to light theme by 7:00AM

You can change those values by modifying the "change_theme_to_dark_time" and "change_theme_to_light_time" variables.

Note: You must use a 24 hour format. EG: "18:00:00"

This script is tested and working on Windows 10.
